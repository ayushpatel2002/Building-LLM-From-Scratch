# Large Language Model from Scratch

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various components involved in developing an LLM, from data preprocessing and model architecture design to training and evaluation. The project uses the classic novel "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen as the training dataset.
